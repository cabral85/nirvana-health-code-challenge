# Coalesce API

## Author: Denis Lopes
## Programming Language: NodeJS / Typescript
## Date: 2021-11-30

## Goal
### Create an API to access other API's and get a balanced result when the result came different in each call

## Commands
### Install Packages: npm install
### BUILD: npm run build
### Start: npm run start
### Test: npm run test



### Sorry I took more time than expected and my tests are not running by complete because I don't remember how to change my processenv variable in jest
### I'm sending incomplete only because have passed too much time since I started, and I had a energy outstage for maybe 1 hour.
